# Samuel Wegner's Portfolio
This document contains a sampling of software development projects to which I have contributed.

## Data Structures
### [string-trie-java](https://github.com/samuelwegner/string-trie-java)
This project contains a Java class (StringTrie) implementing a trie data structure for storing strings, as well as a menu-based console application for manipulating StringTrie objects. I developed this project as an exercise in using pointers to create a linked structure. Tries interest me due to their high performance with large data sets, although their relatively large memory footprint limits their practical use cases. In the future, I want to explore the [DAFSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton) and [HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) data structures as alternatives with similar perfomance and better space efficiency.

### [binary-search-tree-java](https://github.com/samuelwegner/binary-search-tree-java)
This project contains a Java class (BST) implementing a binary search tree data structure for storing generic elements. I developed this as an exercise in navigating and reorganizing a linked structure. The current implementation is usable, although in the future I want to expand it to implement a [red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) that will self-balance at the cost of reduced efficiency during insertion and deletion operations.

## Games
### [Tales of Maj'Eyal](https://git.net-core.org/u/Effigy)
Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is an open-source [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game written in Lua and C, developed by [Netcore Games](https://te4.org/). I have contributed several bug fixes and enhancements to this project; see my activity log on the linked [GitLab page](https://git.net-core.org/u/Effigy) for details. Working on ToME required that I learn a new programming language (Lua), become familiar with a mature codebase, and collaborate with other developers in the community. I also learned to use the Git forking workflow for open-source development.
